TODO
====
Add style/theme so play paragraph's display sensibly/readably and multiple paragraph's can be read as continuous text
Make sure posts sort in right order (based on paragraph number - might need to add this as a tag?)
See how to add user feedback during plugin activation process
Add Named Entity Extraction when loading text - either markup text with microdata or tags
Consider moving act/scene/speaker as custom fields on each post rather than just tags
Add widget to filter/display acts/scenes/paras
Add widget(s) to show additional information or links to other resources while browsing the text
